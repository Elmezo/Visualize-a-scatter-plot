# Visualize-a-scatter-plot
(1)Visualize a scatter plot that represent sepal length, sepal width,
petal length and petal width in Iris Dataset

(2)Visualize a 3D data with gray scale, colored and filled contour plot,
X value = 50 samples from 0 to 5, Y value = 90 samples from 0 to 5,
Z value represented by cos(X*Y*100) using meshgrid function to
build 2D grids from 1D arrays and save your figures in .png images

(3)Perform Inner Join, Outer Join for the following tables
